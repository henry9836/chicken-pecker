it's for virtual box
login is chickenbot, no password 
when you import do not start the first one
clone them
that way you have a fresh untouched one

when in a cloned one open chrome (antix->applications->internet->google chrome)
let the vpn connect, it's been paid for by me
go to temp email
get a temp email from them
go to reddit
sign up with that email
go back to temp email to verify it
this will make it a 5 minute account
then go to r/place
click on the canvas and an auto place bot will run
